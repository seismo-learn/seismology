   地壳震相的几何路径和名称

- **Pg**: At short distances, either an upgoing P wave from a source in the upper crust or a P wave bottoming in the upper crust. At larger distances also arrivals caused by multiple P-wave reverberations inside the whole crust with a group velocity around 5.8 km/s.
- **Pb**: (**alt**: P*) Either an upgoing P wave from a source in the lower crust or a P wave bottoming in the lower crust
- **Pn**: Any P wave bottoming in the uppermost mantle or an upgoing P wave from a source in the uppermost mantle
- **PmP**: P reflection from the outer side of the Moho
- **Sg**: At short distances, either an upgoing S wave from a source in the upper crust or an S wave bottoming in the upper crust. At larger distances also arrivals caused by superposition of multiple S-wave reverberations and SV to P and/or P to SV conversions inside the whole crust.
- **Sb**: (**alt**: S*) Either an upgoing S wave from a source in the lower crust or an S wave bottoming in the lower crust
- **Sn**: Any S wave bottoming in the uppermost mantle or an upgoing S wave from a source in the uppermost mantle
- **SmS**: S reflection from the outer side of the Moho
